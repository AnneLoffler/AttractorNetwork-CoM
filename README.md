# AttractorNetwork-CoM
This project contains the full code for an Attractor Network Model (ANM) simulating Changes of Mind (CoM) in voluntary action, as reported in:
> LÃ¶ffler, Sylaidi, Zafeirios & Haggard (2019). *Two Ways to Change Your Mind: Effects of Intentional Strength and Motor Costs on Changes of Intention.* Submitted for publication.


## Code versions
The model is implemented in both Python and Matlab. 

  * The **'Python'** folder contains all code required to implement the model (**_ANM.py_**) and perform model optimization based on Powell's methods (**_fmin_powell.py_**). 

  * The **'Matlab'** folder contains code that simulates a specified number of trials (**_ANM_runSim.m_**) and plots single-trial model outcomes (**_plotTrials.m_**).
