# AttractorNetwork-CoM
Code for Attractor Network Model (ANM) of Changes of Mind (CoM). 
*[Löffler, Sylaidi, Zafeirios & Haggard (2018; submitted for publication)]*

## Repository description
This project contains the full code for an Attractor Network Model (ANM) simulating Changes of Mind (CoM) in voluntary action. The model reproduces experimental findings described by Löffler, Sylaidi, Zafeirios & Haggard (2018; submitted for publication), which are briefly summarised below.

## Code versions
The model implementation is available in both Python and Matlab. 
The 'Python' folder contains all the code required to perform model optimization. 
The 'Matlab' folder contains code that performs single-trial simulations and plots model outcomes.
