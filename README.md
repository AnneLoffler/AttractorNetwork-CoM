# AttractorNetwork-CoM
This project contains the full code for an Attractor Network Model (ANM) simulating Changes of Mind (CoM) in voluntary action, as reported in:
> LÃ¶ffler, Sylaidi, Fountas & Haggard (2019). *"[A hierarchical attractor network model of perceptual versus intentional decision updates.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22017-2)"* Nature Communications 12.1 (2021): 2020.

### Code versions
The model is implemented in both Python and Matlab. 

  * The ***Python*** folder contains all code required to implement the model (*ANM.py*) and perform model optimization based on Powell's methods (*fmin_powell.py*). 

  * The ***Matlab*** folder contains code that simulates a specified number of trials (*ANM_runSim.m*) and plots single-trial model outcomes (*plotTrials.m*).
